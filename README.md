Project Description:

This was my final project in Java and we had to make the card game war. We had to use everything we learned in java to make this project. 
This was all done using your IDE of choice I used eclipse.

This is a link to a video showcasing all of the features in the project. I am most proud of the volume of code in this project and the time and thought that went into it. 
I also love how easy it is on the User interface side for the user to understand.
